A really quick howto.

The CockroachDB scripts makes use of PostgreSQL's psql client program and libpq
C client library interface, thus any environment variables that libpq would
use.  See dbt2_profile for examples of what environment variables that may be
used.

Create a 1 warehouse database by running dbt2-cockroach-build-db

	dbt2-cockroach-build-db -w 1 -l 26257

Flag description:
	-d <dir> -  Location for data files to load.
	-w #     -  Set the warehouse scale factor.

Additional flags:
	-h            -  Help.
	-r            -  Drop the database before loading, for rebuilding the
                     database.
